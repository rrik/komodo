//! # Action State Management
//!
//! This module provides thread-safe state management for resource exections.
//! It prevents concurrent execution of exections on the same resource using
//! a Mutex-based locking mechanism with RAII guards.
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! - Uses RAII pattern to ensure locks are always released
//! - Handles lock poisoning gracefully
//! - Prevents race conditions through per-resource locks
//! - No deadlock risk: each resource has independent locks
